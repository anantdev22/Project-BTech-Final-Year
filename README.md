**Text Summarisation using Natural Language Processing**

**Overview**
With the ever-growing text data, text summarization seems to have the potential of reducing the reading time by showing summaries of the text documents that capture only the key points in the original documents.

This project looks into text summarisation, giving an overview of different types and approaches toward automatically generating summaries. 
In this project, we will try to use deep learning-based encoder-decoder architecture to create summaries from natural language text automatically.
